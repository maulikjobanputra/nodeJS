Q1 : What is the difference between Java & JavaScript?
Ans:    
    Java Language:-
    1.  It is a Programming language.	
    2.	Java is a pure Object Oriented Programming Language.	
    3.	Java is a Standalone language.	
    4.	Java is a strongly typed language, which means that the user has to decide the data type of the variable before declaring and using it.
        Example "int a", the variable "a" can store the value of integer type only.
    5.	Java program should be compiled before execution.	
    6.	The web-browser is not required to run java programs.
    7.	It is one of the complex languages to learn.	
    8.	In Java, by utilizing the Multi-threading, users can perform complicated tasks.	
    9.	It requires a large amount of memory.	
    10.	Java programming language was developed by the "Sun Microsystems."	
    11.	In Java programming language, programs are saved with the ".java" extension.
    12.	Java is stored on the host machine as the "Byte" code.


    JavaScript Language:-

    1.  It is a scripting language.
    2.	JavaScript is Object-Based Language.
    3.	JavaScript is not a standalone language, as it needs to be integrated into an HTML program for execution.
    4.	JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that the user does not have to worry about the data-type of the variable before and after the declaration.
        Example "var a", the "a" variable can store the value of any data-type.
    5.	JavaScript needs to be integrated into the HTML program for the execution.
    6.	The web-browser is essential to run the JavaScript programs.
    7.	It one of the easy languages to learn.
    8.	In JavaScript, user is not able to perform complicated tasks.
    9.	It does not require that amount of memory.
    10.	JavaScript programming language was developed by the "Netscape."
    11.	On the other hand, programs in JavaScript are saved with the ".js" extension.
    12. JavaScript is stored on the Host machine (client Machine) as the "source" text.

Q2. What is JavaScript?
Ans:
    JavaScript is an object-based lightweight interpreted programming language(scripting language) which is used to make dynamic and interactive web pages.

Q3. What are the data types supported by JavaScript?
Ans:
    There are seven primitive data types in javascript:
    1. Null
    2. Number
    3. Boolean
    4. Bigint
    5. String
    6. symbol
    7. undefined

Q4. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
Ans:
    JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

    1. Block scope:-
        Variables declared inside a { } block.

    2. Function scope:-
        Variables defined inside a function.

    3.Global scope:-
        Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.


Q5. What is Callback?
Ans:
    Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.


Q6. What is Closure? Give an example.
Ans:
    Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
    Example:-
    
    function numberGenerator() {
        // Local “free” variable that ends up within the closure
        var num = 1;
        function checkNumber() { 
            console.log(num);
        }
        num++;
        return checkNumber;
    }

Q7. What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?
Ans:
    == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.
    === is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.

Q8. What is the difference between null & undefined?
Ans:
    Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
    Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

Q9. What would be the result of 2+5+”3″?
Ans:
    73

Q10. What is the difference between Call & Apply?
Ans:
    call() Method in JavaScript
    In this method, a function is called with its arguments which are provided individually.

    apply() Method in JavaScript
    The apply() method takes the arguments of a function in the form of an array, which can be used on different objects.
